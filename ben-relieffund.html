		<h2>Employee Relief Fund</h2>
		<p>To care for patients and families at Memorial Healthcare System, we have to be able to perform at our best – which is tough to do when we have financial worries.</p>

		<p>That’s why Memorial has established the Employee Relief Fund. It can help employees who are dealing with financial hardship or other emergency pay for expenses such as food, housing, utilities or medical treatment.</p>

		<h4>Who’s Eligible?</h4>

		<p>You can apply for support from the Employee Relief Fund if:</p>

		<ul style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">
			<li>You are currently full-time or part-time Memorial employee</li>
			<li>You’re having an unplanned family emergency or financial crisis</li>
			<li>You’ve exhausted all other types of pay, paid leave donations or other sources</li>
			<li>You haven’t received paid leave donations or support from the Employee Relief Fund within the past 12 months</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>How to Apply</h4>
		<p>You must complete and submit an Employee Relief Fund Request Form and 1) detail as accurately as you can the financial emergency you’re experiencing, and 2) include supporting documentation. To access the form, <a href="http://docs/Documents/Policies%20and%20Procedures/Systemwide/Human%20Resources/B-30%20Employee%20Relief%20Fund%20-%20Request%20Form.pdf" target="_blank">click here.</a></p>
		<p>Your request will be reviewed by the Employee Relief Fund Committee. If your request is approved, you’ll receive your assistance payable in a lump sum. Approved requests are paid on regular payroll processing dates.</p>

		<h4>How to Support</h4>

		</ul>
		<h4>Guidelines</h4>
		<ul style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">
			<li>Employees are eligible to receive support from a Memorial emergency assistance program once every 12 months. This includes all assistance received from the Employee Relief Fund, Paid Leave Hardship Withdrawal, and the former Paid Leave Donation Program.</li>
			<li>Maximum grant per incident is $3,000..</li>
			<li>You’ve exhausted all other types of pay, paid leave donations or other sources</li>
			<li>One application per family per incident will be reviewed. For example, if two members of the same immediate family are employed by Memorial, only one can apply for help with a single crisis.</li>
			<li>Assistance will only be offered if funds are available.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>‍‍Applications received when no funds are available will be held for one week. If funds are received during that week, the applications will be considered. If no funds (or insufficient funds) are available, the application will be denied due to lack of funds. This will not preclude the employee from applying again in the future, should they continue to experience the hardship. If the employee chooses to apply again in the future, they will need to submit updated documentation regarding the financial need.</p>
		<p>Guidelines specific to a declared disaster or state of emergency may be developed to assist with administration of the fund during that crisis.</p>
		<h4>COVID-19 Administration Guidelines</h4>
		<h4>Employees who are on unpaid cost containment leave will be given priority consideration. Employees who are currently working or receiving any type of pay will not be in the first priority group.</h4>
		<p>Requests will be prioritized as follows:</p>
		<h4>Priority Group #1</h4>
		<ul style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">
			<li>Employee experiencing financial hardship due to reduction of Memorial operations. (For example, employee is taking unpaid cost containment leave due to lack of assignments.</li>
			<li>Employee has demonstrated financial need or unpaid expenses related to housing, food, utilities, and medical bills.</li>
			<li>Employees requesting assistance due to reduction of work hours must have exhausted all available paid leave (including up to 80 hours of negative balance) prior to requesting assistance.</li>
			<li>Employees who are requesting assistance due to a medical reason for leave must have exhausted all available disability hours.</li>
			<li>Employees will be asked to provide copies of their paystubs or timecards that reflect unpaid cost containment leave.</li>
			<li>Employees who have been offered assignments but have declined are not eligible for assistance.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Priority Group #2</h4>
		<ul style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">
			<li>Employees whose spouse has lost work due to COVID-19 related reasons and are experiencing a financial hardship directly related to COVID-19.</li>
			<li>Proof of loss of employment will be requested.</li>

		</ul>
		<h4>Priority Group #3</h4>
		<ul style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">
			<li>All other requests related to declared disaster or state of emergency.</li>

		</ul>
		<h4>Priority Group #4</h4>
