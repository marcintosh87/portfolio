		<h2>Paid Leave</h2>
		<div class="txtcolumn">
			<p>A healthy work-life balance is a key to success and important to our team’s overall well-being. As caregivers, it's natural for us to take care of others, but we often forget to take care of ourselves. We must all take time off to rest and recharge. As the airlines say,“Put your oxygen mask on first.”</p>

			<p>Taking time off from work is good. It’s proven to reduce stress, enhance sleep, strengthen family ties, and promote happiness.</p>
				
			<p>Memorial’s generous paid leave policy gives us time off to do the things that are important to us – like taking vacations or stay cations, spending time with family and/or friends, catching up on doctor’s appointments or housework, etc.</p>

			<p>You must take your full-time equivalent of two weeks of paid leave each calendar year, including holidays. We hope it doesn’t come to this, butif you are involuntarily terminated for cause or resign in lieu of termination for cause, you won’t receive a payout of your remaining paidleave or disability hours. </p>

			<h3>Disability Leave</h3>
			<p>If you have an illness or accident that causes you to miss more than three days or a maximum of 24 hours of scheduled work time, disability leave can help. The accrual rate is .0231 hours per hour paid.</p>

			<h3>Bereavement Leave</h3>
			<p>If you’re a full- or part-time employee, you can use three days of paid bereavement leave at any time for a death in your immediate family – such as your spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandchild, sibling, grandparent, mother-in-law, or father-in-law.</p>
