	   <h4>How Does Memorial Decide Your Pay?</h4>
	   <div class="txtcolumn">
	   <p>There are many advantages to a career with Memorial Healthcare System – the opportunity to be part of one of the nation’s leading healthcare employers, the chance to learn and grow on the job, and the ability to create a satisfying and rewarding life for you and your family in South Florida. </p>
	   <p>We understand that one of your most important concerns is your pay. So how do we determine the salaries of our 14,000 employees?</p>
	   <p><b>These factors play a part:</b></p>
	   <ul style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 20px;"><li>Your job</li>
	   <li>The required qualifications for your job</li>
	   <li>The going market rate for your job (its estimated market value). We use a number of third-party salary surveys and studies to gather this data.</li></ul>
	   <p>A job’s estimated market value is the average of what other companies are paying for similar “benchmark” jobs (those that are usually found in healthcare systems across the country, like nurse, therapist, or coder).</p>
	   <p><b>Other factors we consider can include:</b></p>
	   <ul style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 20px;">
		<li>Whether a job is easy or difficult to recruit for</li>
	   <li>Whether a job’s turnover rate is high or low</li>
	   <li>Our responsibility as a public healthcare system to provide high-quality care in a cost-effective manner</li></ul>
	   <p><b>Your compensation is not just the figure on your paycheck. It also includes benefits of being a Memorial employee, such as: </b></p>
	   <ul style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 20px;">
			   <li>Medical, dental, and vision coverage</li>
			   <li>Retirement plans</li>
			   <li>Disability benefits</li>
			   <li>Life insurance</li>
			   <li>Fun events through MEET</li>
			   <li>Opportunities to learn and grow in your healthcare career</li>
			   <li>Access to the Memorial Employees’ Federal Credit Union</li>
			   <li>Humana LifeSolutions (EAP)</li>
			   <li>Free parking</li>
			   <li>And more</li></ul>
		
		<p>benefits and compensation teams work daily to ensure you are receiving a competitive, rewarding compensation package. It’s one of the ways we thank you for everything you do to heal the body, mind, and spirit of those we touch.</p>
