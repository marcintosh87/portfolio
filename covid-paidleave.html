		<h4><i>Have questions? Talk to your leader or the HR team at your Memorial facility, or call the HR Service Center at (954) 265-5903</i></h4>

		<h2>Paid Leave</h2>
		
		<p>As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Memorial is extending the freeze on all time off requests through Sunday, May 31. We are taking this step to help ensure that we are fully staffed to meet the challenges of the pandemic in our community, and to help ensure the health and safety of our patients, their families, and everyone we serve. If you have a pre-approved request for time off between now and May 31, please speak with your leader. Thank you for your continued understanding and for your commitment to each other and our community during this difficult time.</p>	
		<h4>Relaxed Paid Leave Requirements for New Hires</h4>
		<p>‍We’ve temporarily relaxed the paid leave requirement for new hires. New employees can now use their accrued paid leave starting 30 days after their date of hire, instead of having to wait six months, effective Wednesday, March 25. </p>
		<h4>Paid Leave Advancement
		</h4>
		<p>Memorial changed its Paid Leave Policy to allow employees to use paid leave up to a negative balance of 80 hours, with any leave earned after that applying until the balance is no longer negative. If you leave employment with Memorial – or convert from full-time or part-time status to staff relief – the dollar amount of your negative balance will be withheld from your final paycheck(s) up to the allowable amount.</p>
